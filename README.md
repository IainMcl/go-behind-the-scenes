# Go Behind The Scenes

Having some experimentation with Go Apis. Using a combination of learning
from YouTube, [https://github.com/eddycjy/go-gin-example](), and 'The Go Programming Language'.

TODO:

* There is an issue with the `register` route returning a 200 but also disconnecting from the client.
